    How the Language works

        when want to make a function, You shall start with "func"/"function" then the type of the function ("int"/"void")
        then the name of the function which results in:
                    
                    func int main(){

                    } 

        To initialise a variable, You shall start with the variable's type then the name the equal sign then the value,
        then the semicolon; which results in:
                    int integer = 20;
